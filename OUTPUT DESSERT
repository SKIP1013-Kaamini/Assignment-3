A tart is a baked dish consisting of a filling over a pastry base with an open top not covered with pastry. 
The pastry is usually shortcrust pastry; the filling may be sweet or savoury, 
though modern tarts are usually fruit-based, sometimes with custard. 
Tartlet refers to a miniature tart; an example would be egg tarts. 
The categories of "tart", "flan", "quiche", and "pie" overlap, with no sharp distinctions.

Pudding is a type of food that can be either a dessert or a savoury (salty or spicy) dish that is part of the main meal.

In the United States and Canada, pudding characteristically denotes a sweet, 
milk-based dessert similar in consistency to egg-based custards, instant custards or a mousse, 
often commercially set using cornstarch, gelatin or similar coagulating agent such as Jell-O.
